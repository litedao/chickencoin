chickencoin
===

ChickenCoin is a degenerate DAO-like. It allows converting back and forth between ETH and shares of the pool of ETH, called "CHI". It charges a deposit and withdrawal fee of 0.5% each way.

The name comes from the fact that it is a continuous game of chicken: you make returns (in ETH) if you convert to CHI, then enough other people convert in and out, then you convert out.

CHI is an example of an acceptable collateral type for Maker. It follows the token standard and can't break Maker by misbehaving.
