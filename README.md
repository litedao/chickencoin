Don't put your Ether into this contract. Seriously. I don't know what else to say.

ChickenCoin is a degenerate DAO-like. It allows converting back and forth between ETH and shares of the pool of ETH, called "CHI". It charges a deposit and withdrawal fee of 0.5% each way.

The name comes from the fact that it is a continuous game of chicken: you make returns (in ETH) if you convert to CHI, then enough other ETH converts in and out, then you convert out. Your max losses are 1% of your ETH deposit, if you convert in and immediately convert back out (or 100% if there is a critical bug).

ChickenCoin starts with an initial balance of 1 ETH and 1 CHI, setting the initial "price" at 1. ChickenCoin's ETH balance will grow continuously, since it is the first "participant" and never cashes out.

CHI is an example of an acceptable collateral type for Maker. It follows the token standard (ABI and semantics) and can't break Maker by misbehaving.
